\subsection{Equipment}
The tests were carried out on 3 identical virtual machines, each one with the following specifications:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{CPU}: 1 core (2 logical cores) of an Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4208 CPU @ 2.10GHz
	\item \textbf{RAM}: 6.8GB
	\item \textbf{Disk}: 40GB
	\item \textbf{OS}: Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS
\end{itemize}
The Java application used the whole equipment, while the Python and Rust applications used only one 
logical core on one machine.
